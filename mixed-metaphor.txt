That is water over the bridge.
Jumping out the fire into the frying pan.
Hindsight is 50-50.
A bird in hand is worth bushes.
I am so hungry I could eat like a horse.
It is no skin off of my teeth.
Don't look a gift horse in the eye.
You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make him drown.
She is an open diary
He wears his heart on his socks
It’s snowtime"
These are the kitten days of summer
You’re building sandcastles in the air
I was a million inches away
He skips to his own drummer
Spitting hairs
Pickknitting
The whole burrito
A five-to-nine job
Touch the books
Uncover your bases
This zoo is a place
To carry a torch because its dark
Blood-orange from a turnip
Step up to the bowl
Parade-maker
More than you can shake a stick at
Heart of mold
My dogs are barking
Go back to the drawling board
Cut me some lack
To get out of foot
To touch the sack
To be on the bat
To feel under the blanket
Speak of deviled eggs
To sight the bullet
A chime a dollar
To ment corners
To catch the boat
To pull someone’s ear
Markup my words
To have mittens
To wrap your scarf around something
Mama kitten
A day late and a doll is short
Bent out of line
By the skin of your nose
Tofu days
A hangpuppy expression
To get caught right-handed
A wild-moose chase
Hurting cats
The elephant in the zoo
Hit the head on the nail
