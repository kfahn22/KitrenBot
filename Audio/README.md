# Audio

I haven't gotten this to work with Gemini or Ollama, but might work with OpenAI. Look at the voice.js file, which I copied from [here](https://github.com/developersdigest/Create-Your-Own-Voice-Assistant-with-Node.js-Langchain-Eleven-Labs-in-9-Minutes/blob/main/index.js).

I also think the functionality is better with Python.
